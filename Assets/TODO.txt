-Add a sound when a fruit is tossed in the air
-Play an animation when a fruit gameobject is destroyed "fruitbehavious.Destroy()"
-Do something when a new HighScore was reached (animation maybe)
-Add tabs to the menu (Global/Current Game)
-Make the menus look nicer (Border)
-Randomly select 2 fruits on the map, that give bonus points when combined together

[BUGS]
-(Warning) MaximizedWindow is not currently supported on Windows, setting to FullsceenWindow instead (Error Log in build)
-Null-reference in "BackgroundController.cs:122" when playmode is ending (only in editor)
-MaxHeight countdown started even though no fruit was inside the collider. Countdown stopped the FruitSpwner released its fruit. (Should be fixed, needs more testing)
