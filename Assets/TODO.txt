-Do something when a new HighScore was reached (animation maybe)

[BUGS]
-(Warning) MaximizedWindow is not currently supported on Windows, setting to FullsceenWindow instead (Error Log in build)
-Null-reference in "BackgroundController.cs:122" when playmode is ending (only in editor)
-MaxHeight countdown started even though no fruit was inside the collider. Countdown stopped the FruitSpwner released its fruit. (Should be fixed, needs more testing)
